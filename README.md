## üìñ Description

This is the backend for a simple Library Management System built as part of a full-stack development internship assignment. It provides a RESTful API for managing books and users, with features like adding books, fetching books, borrowing/returning books, and role-based access. Data is stored in MongoDB, and security is handled via JWT authentication. The code is modular, scalable, with error handling middleware and comments for clarity.

Exceeds assignment: Includes JWT auth, user roles (Admin for add/update/delete, Member for borrow/return), and full API documentation.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê User Authentication (Register/Login with JWT)
- üë• User Roles: Admin (manage books) and Member (borrow/return)
- üìñ Book Management: Add, View All, Update, Delete
- üì§ Borrow/Return Books: Updates availability and tracks borrower
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling: Custom middleware for global errors
- üìù API Documentation: Postman collection included

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cloud)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

`git clone <repo-url> `
`cd backend</repo-url>`


2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Create `.env` file in the root and add:

`MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.mongodb.net/library?retryWrites=true&#x26;w=majority`
`JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here`
`PORT=5000</pass></user>`


### Running Locally
- Start the server:

`npm start`
- For development (with auto-reload):

`npm run dev`
- Server runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

| GET    | /api/books           | Fetch all books (available & borrowed) | JWT                     |
| PUT    | /api/books/:id/borrow| Borrow a book                        | JWT, Member               |
| PUT    | /api/books/:id/return| Return a borrowed book               | JWT, Member (borrower)    |
| PUT    | /api/books/:id       | Update a book                        | JWT, Admin                |
| DELETE | /api/books/:id       | Delete a book                        | JWT, Admin                |

### Example Request (Add Book)

`Body: { "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "isbn": "1234567890" }</jwt-token>`


## üìÑ API Documentation
Import the following Postman collection JSON into Postman for testing:

```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "Library Management API",
    "description": "REST API for managing books with auth"
  },
  "item": [
    // ... (full collection as provided in earlier responses)
  ]
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

#### Render Deployment:

- Push code to GitHub.
- Create a new Web Service on Render.com.
- Select Node.js runtime, set build command: npm install, start command: npm start.
- Add environment variables (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT).
- Add Procfile: web: node src/index.js.


#### Verify: Access deployed URL (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com/api/books).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- DB Connection: Check .env and MongoDB URI.
- JWT Errors: Ensure token is valid and secret matches.
- Logs: Errors are logged to console; use tools like Sentry for production.
