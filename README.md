# üìö Library Management System Backend

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v20.x-green) ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-v4.18-blue) ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-v7.x-brightgreen) ![JWT](https://img.shields.io/badge/JWT-Authentication-orange)

## üìñ Description

This is the backend for a simple Library Management System built as part of a full-stack development internship assignment. It provides a RESTful API for managing books and users, with features like adding books, fetching books, borrowing/returning books, and role-based access. Data is stored in MongoDB, and security is handled via JWT authentication. The code is modular, scalable, with error handling middleware and comments for clarity.

Exceeds assignment: Includes JWT auth, user roles (Admin for add/update/delete, Member for borrow/return), and full API documentation.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê User Authentication (Register/Login with JWT)
- üë• User Roles: Admin (manage books) and Member (borrow/return)
- üìñ Book Management: Add, View All, Update, Delete
- üì§ Borrow/Return Books: Updates availability and tracks borrower
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling: Custom middleware for global errors
- üìù API Documentation: Postman collection included

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cloud)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

`git clone <repo-url> `
`cd backend</repo-url>`


2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Create `.env` file in the root and add:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

#### Render Deployment:

- Push code to GitHub.
- Create a new Web Service on Render.com.
- Select Node.js runtime, set build command: npm install, start command: npm start.
- Add environment variables (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT).
- Add Procfile: web: node src/index.js.


#### Verify: Access deployed URL (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com/api/books).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- DB Connection: Check .env and MongoDB URI.
- JWT Errors: Ensure token is valid and secret matches.
- Logs: Errors are logged to console; use tools like Sentry for production.
